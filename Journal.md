This week I decided on what my project was going to be. I also have a rough idea for what my problem statement is too. I am working on the wireframe right now. Thank goodness I took the UML class or else I'd have no idea what a wireframe was. I began researching code on calculations to get a rough idea of the direction I need to take. I need to read up on this a little more before class next week.

# Week 2: 1/25/2016 - 1/29/2016
Tasks Completed:
 * Chose a project goal
 * Wrote the problem statement
 * Started documenting the project plan
 
This week I decided on what my project was going to be. I also have a rough idea for what my problem statement is too. I am working on the wireframe right now. Thank goodness I took the UML class or else I'd have no idea what a wireframe was. I began researching code on calculations to get a rough idea of the direction I need to take. I need to read up on this a little more before class next week.

In trying to complete Week 2 of activites, exercises, projects, and extracirriculars, I've realized that the work load in this class feels like 2 classes. I spend a lot of time thinking about this class and what I need to complete. If I were simply a student without a full time job, this workload would feel heavy, but manageable. With my full time job, I feel like this is already a lot and I haven't even been to the 3rd class yet. Don't get me wrong though, I really love that fact that we're learning a lot and using applications and services that employers are seeking because this will not only help me build my skill set but also my resume. 

On another note, I don't care too much for the extracirriculars mainly because I already have a job in programming and I feel like this is more work on my already very full plate. It is nice to know about opportunities that I may not be aware of otherwise, but I know if I had more time and wanted to seek out other activities, I would research that on my own. 
 
# Week 3:
I feel super over whelmed with everything that I need to get done. Learning a bunch of new applications, learning new Java material, keeping up with the exercises, going to extra cirricular activities, creating a powerpoint presentation for the extra cirricular activities, implementing the new material into my project, story boarding my GUI, actually coding my individual project, finding time for my other 3 classes, working full time... Definitely feeling like I have too much on my plate right now. I don't know how moms do it.


# Week 4:


# Week 5:
Worked on getting security added to my project.

# Week 6:
Somehow I lost some files in my IdeasProject folder. Lately, I've been moving around some files and I must've accidentally deleted them! Darn it. This week I am trying to configure the security and trying to find wsdl's that could possibly work in my app. My team and I also have the beginning stages of our application set to go. We are working on an application that will automate a rotational schedule I currently have to put together at work. I am also keeping extracirricular 2 in the back of my mind. It'd be cool to do some Java related volunteer program. I will have to look into this later.

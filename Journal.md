# Week 2: 1/25/2016 - 1/29/2016
Tasks Completed:
 * Chose a project goal
 * Wrote the problem statement
 * Started documenting the project plan
 
This week I decided on what my project was going to be. I also have a rough idea for what my problem statement is too. I am working on the wireframe right now. Thank goodness I took the UML class or else I'd have no idea what a wireframe was. I began researching code on calculations to get a rough idea of the direction I need to take. I need to read up on this a little more before class next week.

In trying to complete Week 2 of activites, exercises, projects, and extracirriculars, I've realized that the work load in this class feels like 2 classes. I spend a lot of time thinking about this class and what I need to complete. If I were simply a student without a full time job, this workload would feel heavy, but manageable. With my full time job, I feel like this is already a lot and I haven't even been to the 3rd class yet. Don't get me wrong though, I really love that fact that we're learning a lot and using applications and services that employers are seeking because this will not only help me build my skill set but also my resume. 

On another note, I don't care for the extracirriculars mainly because I already have a job in programming and I feel like this is more work on my already very full plate. It is nice to know about opportunities that I may not be aware of otherwise, but I know if I had more time and wanted to seek out other activities, I would research that on my own.
